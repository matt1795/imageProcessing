    \item \textbf{An image has defined as  $f(x,y) = \sin(2x + 3y)$, find the Fourier transform of
    this image $F(u,v)$.}

    \item \textbf{An image $f( x,y)$ is padded with zeros and the result is
    called $g(x,y)$.  Explain the difference you think will appear in $F(u,v)$
    and $G(u,v)$?}

    The zero padding introduces sharp edges on all sides of the image so there
    will be larger magnitudes at higher frequencies for both rows and columns.
    The zero padding also decreases the average value of the image reducing the
    DC portion of the rows and columns.

    \item \textbf{Find the filter transfer function $H(u,v)$ for a filter that
    averages the four immediate neighbors of a point $(x,y)$ , but does not
    include $f(x,y)$?}

    Given the description above, I can easily come up with a convolution matrix:
    
    \begin{equation*}
	h(x,y) = \frac{1}{4} \times
	\begin{bmatrix}
	    0 & 1 & 0 \\
	    1 & 0 & 1 \\
	    0 & 1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}

    This matrix is also known as the impulse response. In order to get the
    frequenzy response, I can simple put it through a Z-Transform.

    \item \textbf{A Gaussian low pass filter with $\sigma = 1$. Has the transfer
    function of $H_{LP}(u,v) = Ae^{-\frac{(u^2 + v^2)}{2}}$.
    Find $h_{LP}(x,y)$ and also $h_{HP}(x,y)$}

    \item \textbf{Consider a 2D image $f(x,y) = \cos(4\pi x)\times \sin(8\pi y)$}

    \begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries, label=\alph*.]

	\item \textbf{Determine its Fourier Transform, $F(u,v)$ and illustrate}

	\item \textbf{suppose this signal is sampled uniformly with sampling
	interval $\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta = \frac{1}{6}$. Draw the spectrum
	of the sampled signal}

	\item \textbf{suppose the sampled signal is filtered by an ideal
	low-pass filter $h_1(x,y)$ with frequency response:
	\begin{equation*}
	H_1(u,v) =
	    \begin{cases}
		\Delta^2 , -\frac{f_s}{2} \prec u, v \prec \frac{f_s}{2}\\
		0, \hspace{1 em} \text{Otherwise}
	    \end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	Where, $f_s = \frac{1}{\Delta}$. Draw the spectrum of the
	reconstructed signal .Give the spatial representation of the
	reconstructed signal $f_{r1}(x,y)$}

    \end{enumerate}
